BSY Bonus - Task5️⃣
==================
Command and Control using Github Gist written in .Net Core 7. For fun, it is written with the theme of pastoralism 🐑🐕.

**Supported bots's OS:** Linux🐧

❗***DISCLAIMER:*** *Mandatory Github token is not presenet in the repository (SheepController and ShepherdController), so the code does not run out of the box*❗

# 🧑🏻‍🏫 How to run it

1. You can download the latest precompiled binaries from [Releases](https://github.com/pan-sveta/BSY-Bonus-C-C/releases/tag/1.1.0)
2. Also you need to obtain Github Access token **with Gist read/write privilidge** [tutorial here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token)
3. Then you have to create empty Gist which will server as a hub gist and copy its **Id**
4. After you download Sheep and/or Shepherd, you have to edit appsettings.json and provide the hub gist id and token
5. Happy hacking! 🏴‍☠️
